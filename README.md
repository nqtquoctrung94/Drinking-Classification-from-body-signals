# Drinking Classification from body signals
This repository contains code and results for a project classification of drinking behavior based on results from general check-up. 

The project aims to explore medical terms and identify the most effective classification models for this dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Smoking and Drinking Dataset with body signal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooyoungher/smoking-drinking-dataset).

# Classification models
This projects used the following models and then compared the performance of them
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K Nearest Neighbor

# Models comparison
The methods of comparison used in this projects are based on:
- Precision, Recall and F1-score
- Accuracy Score
- ROC score

# Files
The project is organized as follow:
- EDA and ML models: `EDA_and_Classification_Models.ipynb`
- Report:
  - `Report-full.pdf` for full view
  - `Report-preview.pdf` for 4 slides per page view
